# Annotations
 Annotations can be found in the myNotes folder. Notes are organzied by video section as structured by FEM. 

 Observation: To get the most out of this workshop I would highly recommend that you go through the exercises. The lectures are great for context and the slides are handy references, but a bulk of understanding through this course comes from reading and doing the exercises.
