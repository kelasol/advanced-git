# Forks & Remote Repos
## Github vs. Git
### Distributed Version Control
- We've been talking about the tool, git, but let's talk about what it can do now in the context of distributed repositories. Things used to be held in a central repository

### Github vs Git - The Key is Collaboration
- Git:
    - Open source version control software
- Github: (the following are all Github features, not Git)...  
    - Repository hosting
    - Browse Code
    - Issues
    - Pull Requests
    - Forks

Github real key driver to open source accessibilty.
- Launched in 2008! (Baffling!)
- Github changed the game

## Remotes
### Remotes
- A **remote** is a git repository stored elsewhere - on the web, in github, etc.
- **origin** is the default name git gives to the server you cloned from.

- Cloning a remote repository from a URL will fetch the whole repository, and make a local copy in your .git folder

- You may have different privileges for a remote.
    - Read/Write for some, Read Only for other

### Clone Repository git clone
- We make a copy called a clone on the local machine.
- origin is the default name given  
- all git command , push ,pull all work on _origin_

### Viewing Remotes
`git remote -v`
`> origin git@github.com:lisa/projA.git (fetch)`
`> origin git@github.com:lisa/projA.git (push)`
Will help you view what your remotes are,.
